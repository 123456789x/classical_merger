# Classical Merger
Implements a mergesort algorithm to efficiently sort through a list.

## Running
In order to begin the process, start the `linker.py` file located in the `lib/` directory.

During voting, use "end" to end the process and save; use "done" to finish the merge when both options are blank; use "reset" to reset the merge to the beginning. After a cycle, press "n" to stop the process and save.
