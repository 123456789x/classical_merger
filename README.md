Each piece is categorized as either primary, secondary, or tertiary priority levels. Furthermore, a status is assigned: fluency, memorization, or polishing.

Primary priority level is the highest one. PIeces denoted primary mean that they are the main pieces in rotation: usually 5, sometimes 6 works. Primary works get more attention from the system than other priority levels.

Secondary priority level are for pieces that ARE COMPLETED. These pieces have gone through primary already, and have been switched out for new pieces. However, it is rewarding to keep them maintained, which is how this system works. Studies have shown that in order to keep a pice in PERMANENT MEMORY, 3-4 cycles of memorization then forgetting is needed. Therefore, the computer will purposely program a gap of secondary works for a period of 3-4 months, then assign a period of study for 1-2 months.

Tertiary priority level are for pieces that are played not for concert use, but for repertoire enhancement or study. They are not intended for performance usage - rather, for study to apply to other pieces. It is possible at any point in this stage, however, to promote it to the primary level. For tertiary level pieces, the program will consider practice time, assign primary and secondary pieces, and only then consider tertiary pieces.
