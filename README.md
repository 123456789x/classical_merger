# Classical Merger
Implements a mergesort algorithm to efficiently sort through a list.

## Running
In order to begin the process, start the `linker.py` file located in the `lib/` directory.

During voting, use "end" to end the process and save; use "done" to finish the merge when both options are blank; use "reset" to reset the merge to the beginning. After a cycle, press "n" to stop the process and save.

## Files
The `data/` directory contains all necessary files. A beginning system has the value "0" in the `store` file, the value "1 \n 1" in the `status` file, an empty `wlist` file, and the `list` file containing your original unsorted list.

At the end of the entire process, there should be a list named `list1` that would be the list but sorted.
